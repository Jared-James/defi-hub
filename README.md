#### Version: 1.0.0
- I wanted to build anything in nextJS that pulls in an API and renders the content.

#### Version: 1.0.1
- I wanted to be able to go into each individual coin and see more detail about it.

#### Version: 1.0.2
- I wanted to be able to see the data plotted on a graph, however in retrospect I used Chart.js and I will be migrating it over to HighCharts, because their charts look much nicer and have more functionality. 

#### Version 1.0.3
- I added a search feature so you can search for the coins rather than having to scroll and find.

#### Version 1.0.4
- I changed the colour scheme from #000 to #fff, this was a big improvement in my eyes. I think Iâ€™m much more favouring a lighter colour pallet these days.

#### Version 1.0.5
- I added a scrolling header that has the symbols and their 24H % change, I've always wanted to add one of these. 

#### Version 1.0.6
- I added the ability to sort for all categories. Name | Symbol | 24H Change & Last Price

#### Version 1.0.6
 - COMMING SOON; WORK IN PROGRESS
